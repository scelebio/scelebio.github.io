    <p>My name is Sarper Celebioglu. Originally I am from Turkey. I have been living in the USA for 2 years. I am a mechanical engineer. I am intending to combine my engineering skills with web development courses.</p>
    <p>I took my first html class when I was in Turkey. There was an optional class for engineering students which is preferred by the computer science engineers. I was the only one taking that class although my major is not really related with it. My favourite website is <a href="https://www.expedia.com/" rel="noopener norefererrer" target="_blank">Expedia</a>. This platform makes collobarations with the companies that are giving services such as accomadation, renting cars, flight tickets etc. With this website you have a chance to compare all the competitors and catch the best deals</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#leftnav" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Student Counselling</a> department works really effective and fast. You can book any of the counsellors related with your programme before you go there. So you never lost your time in the endless lines. The staff on the frontdesk is really friendly and helpful</p>
