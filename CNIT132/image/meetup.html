            <p>Attended to an online meeting through meetup on 21st of April, 2020.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the meeting was demonstration of the core elements of HTML5 web page, css and a little intro to Javascript.</p>
            <p>The host wanted everybody to introduce themselves shortly to have an idea of the audience. I mentioned that I am a student at CCSF and currently taking HTML and Java Script Classes.</p>
            <p>The video conference lasted in approximately 2 hours.</p> 
            <p>The host started with the structure of an HTML web page like how to start up, how to proceed and how to finalize the page structure.</p>
            <p>Then the basic elements such as headers, paragraphs, ordered and unordered listed items, link connections were demonstrated.</p>
            <p>After having a basic webpage consisting of few headers and paragraphs, we started styling the elements via css by giving id and class to the related elements.</p>    
            <p>The host didn't go into detail of the Javascript but he just mentioned what could be done with JavaScript once the audience got an idea on building up a basic web page.</p>
